# SKINET (Segmentation of the KIdney through a Neural nETwork) Project

SKINET Project is meant to perform a segmentation of a kidney's biopsy or a nephrectomy and recognize the different histological structures. By doing that, it is possible to analyze kidneys more precisely and get a better understanding of their behaviors.

The project's code is based on [Matterport's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) and [Navidyou's repository](https://github.com/navidyou/Mask-RCNN-implementation-for-cell-nucleus-detection-executable-on-google-colab-).

This project is a collaboration between a Nephrology team from [Dijon Burgundy Teaching Hospital](https://www.chu-dijon.fr/), [LEAD Laboratory](http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/en/), and a student from [ESIREM](https://esirem.u-bourgogne.fr/), all located in Dijon, Burgundy, France.
